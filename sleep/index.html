    <h1> <strong>Master its sleep!</strong></h1>
    <img src="../img/sleep.jpg" alt="sleeping cat">
    <p>This gentleman right here represents the best
    position for a good night's sleep. Why is it
    the best?
    </p>
    <strong>BECAUSE HE LIKES IT</strong></p></p>
    <h3>There are a couple of rules though when it comes 
    to making your cat sleep like a baby.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The ground should be as hard as it 
            possibly can, lay your tiger on a floor.
            Tiles preferably.
        </li>
        <li>The cat must be surrounded by some
            kind of a non-transparent matter. Plastic
            will fit. Or fabric. Or whatever he decides.</li>
        <li>The size of the <i>bedroom</i> should
            allow the cat to get into it and be able to do pretty 
            much nothing else.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>"But Aya! What should I do when my cat
        doesn't want to sleep?"</i></p>
        <h4>Here I come with a solution, pal.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to make him tired. Play with
            him for a little. Do some tricks so his
            brain is boiling.
        </li>
        <li>Play him his favourite song. This could
            be a magical, Potterish soundtrack or
            different meowy ballads from the internet
            abyss. 
        </li>
        <li>Give up. He'll do whatever tf he 
            wants to
        </li>
    </ol>
